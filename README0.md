# Theory of Entropicity (ToE)

The Theory of Entropicity (ToE) is a foundational framework that positions entropy as the primary substrate of reality. This repository serves as the official digital home of the theory, consolidating its conceptual foundations, mathematical structures, derivations, and expository materials.

## Purpose of This Repository
- Preserve the canonical formulations of ToE  
- Provide a structured archive of equations, principles, and derivations  
- Document the evolution of the theory from early insights to formal results  
- Offer accessible expositions for researchers, students, and the general public  
- Serve as a stable, long‑term reference independent of any single publishing platform  

## Multi‑Stage Diffusion Pipeline
The development of ToE follows a multi‑stage diffusion pipeline:

1. **Rapid Ideation**  
   Early insights circulate through Blogger, Medium, LinkedIn, and Substack.

2. **Consolidation**  
   Mature ideas are refined into structured arguments.

3. **Formal Archival Publication**  
   Final papers are published on ResearchGate, Academia.edu, SSRN, Figshare, and Cambridge Open Engage.

4. **Return Flow**  
   Even “frozen” ideas return to public platforms for renewed exposition, reinterpretation, and popular explanation.

This repository anchors the entire ecosystem.

## Repository Structure
- `/concepts` — Core definitions and conceptual foundations  
- `/equations` — Mathematical formulations and field equations
