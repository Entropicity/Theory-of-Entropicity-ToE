# Foundations of Entropicity

The Theory of Entropicity begins with a single ontological claim: **entropy is the substrate of reality**. Everything else — geometry, fields, particles, forces, information, and even the flow of time — emerges from entropic gradients and their evolution.

## 1. Entropy as Ontological Substance
In classical physics, entropy is treated as a measure. In ToE, entropy is treated as a substance — the fundamental “stuff” of existence. It is not a descriptor of systems; it is the medium from which systems arise.

## 2. The Entropic Manifold
Reality is modeled as an entropic manifold: a continuous, differentiable structure whose local and global properties are determined by entropic density and its gradients. Geometry is not imposed; it emerges from entropic curvature.

## 3. Ontodynamics
Ontodynamics is the study of how existence evolves when entropy is the primary field. It replaces force‑based dynamics with gradient‑driven evolution. Motion, interaction, and causality arise from entropic flows.

## 4. Emergence of Physical Law
Physical laws are not axioms but constraints that emerge from the stability conditions of entropic evolution. Constants of nature correspond to fixed points in the entropic landscape.

## 5. The Role of Information
Information is treated as a geometric expression of entropic structure. It is not dual to entropy; it is a projection of entropy onto a representational manifold.

This document establishes the conceptual bedrock upon which the mathematical formulation of ToE is built.
