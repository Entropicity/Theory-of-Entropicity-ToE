<h1>Who has Declared that Entropy is the Foundation of Physics and Natural Laws and that Entropy is a Field and more Fundamental than Spacetime Itself?</h1>

  <a id="anchor-entropy-foundation"></a>
  <h2>Entropy as the Foundational Field of Physics and the Emergence of Spacetime</h2>

  <p>
    The explicit declaration that <strong>entropy</strong> is the <em>fundamental field of existence</em>, more primary than spacetime and serving as the substrate from which spacetime itself emerges, is due to <strong>John Onimisi Obidi</strong>, originator of the <strong>Theory of Entropicity</strong> (<strong>ToE</strong>). In this framework, entropy is not merely a thermodynamic quantity or a statistical descriptor of microstates; it is elevated to the status of a <strong>universal entropic field</strong> that underlies and generates the familiar structures of <strong>space</strong>, <strong>time</strong>, and <strong>matter</strong>. The ToE thus proposes a radical ontological shift: what is usually treated as a derived quantity becomes the primary field, and what is usually treated as fundamental (spacetime) becomes emergent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within this perspective, the entropic field is conceived as the <strong>fundamental field of existence</strong>, sometimes described metaphorically as the “heartbeat of reality,” but technically understood as a scalar field of <strong>entropic accessibility</strong> defined on an underlying informational substrate. The familiar spacetime manifold, with its metric structure and causal relations, is then interpreted as an emergent, effective description of how this entropic field organizes possible configurations and constrains physical evolution. In analogy with how <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> elevated the speed of light \( c \) to a universal constant that structures relativistic physics, Obidi’s formulation elevates entropy to a universal field that structures the entire ontology of physical law.

    Obidi’s Theory of Entropicity and the Entropic Field as Primary Ontology
  </h3>

  <p>
    In the <strong>Theory of Entropicity</strong>, the central object is a scalar field of <strong>entropic accessibility</strong>, typically denoted by \( S(x) \), where \( x \) labels events in an emergent spacetime description. This field does not represent thermodynamic entropy in the classical sense of heat or disorder; instead, it encodes the <strong>possibility structure</strong> of the universe. At each event, the value \( S(x) \) measures the number of compatible microconfigurations of the universe that realize the macroscopic conditions at that event, together with the degree of openness of future evolution from that point. Spacetime geometry, matter distributions, and dynamical laws are then understood as emergent manifestations of how this entropic field constrains and organizes accessible configurations.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this formulation, the entropic field is not defined on a pre-given spacetime manifold in the fundamental sense; rather, spacetime itself is reconstructed as an effective, large-scale description of the relational structure induced by the entropic field. The metric \( g_{\mu\nu}(x) \), causal structure, and geodesic motion arise as secondary constructs that encode how trajectories of physical systems respond to gradients of entropic accessibility. The universe is thus described as evolving within an <strong>entropic landscape</strong>, where motion, interaction, and structure formation are governed by the interplay between local accessibility and global entropic constraints.

    Comparative Perspectives: Entropy, Emergent Spacetime, and Related Frameworks
  </h3>

  <p>
    Although Obidi’s Theory of Entropicity is distinctive in explicitly declaring entropy to be the <strong>fundamental field</strong> from which spacetime emerges, several influential theoretical frameworks in contemporary physics have explored closely related ideas in which entropy, information, or statistical structure play a foundational role. These approaches differ in their ontological commitments and mathematical formulations, but they share the common theme that spacetime and its dynamics are not primitive, but arise from deeper informational or entropic principles.
  </p>

  <p>
    In <strong>Erik Verlinde’s</strong> formulation of <strong>entropic gravity</strong>, gravity is interpreted as an emergent phenomenon arising from changes in entropy associated with the positions of material bodies. The gravitational interaction is not treated as a fundamental force mediated by a field in spacetime; instead, it is derived from entropic considerations linked to underlying microscopic degrees of freedom and their information content. Verlinde’s work suggests that spacetime and gravity may be emergent from a more fundamental description in terms of quantum information, although it does not explicitly promote entropy itself to the status of a universal field in the same sense as ToE.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Carlo Rovelli’s</strong> <strong>thermal time hypothesis</strong> offers another perspective in which entropy plays a central role in the emergence of temporal structure. In this framework, time is not a fundamental parameter but arises from the statistical state of a system. The flow of time is associated with the evolution of a statistical state relative to a chosen algebra of observables, and entropy provides an internal “clock” that orders events. Here, entropy is not a field in spacetime but a property of statistical states, yet the conceptual shift is similar: temporal ordering and the arrow of time are emergent from entropic structure rather than being primitive.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Ginestra Bianconi</strong> has proposed a framework in which gravity emerges from entropy within a quantum information–theoretic setting. In her approach, the metric of spacetime is treated as an operator, and <strong>quantum relative entropy</strong> is used to describe the interaction between geometry and matter. This leads to a picture in which information-theoretic quantities dictate the structure of spacetime, and gravitational dynamics are derived from entropic principles. While this is conceptually close to the idea that entropy underlies spacetime, it is formulated in terms of operator-valued geometry and quantum information rather than a universal scalar entropic field.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Jeremy England</strong> has advanced the view that the law of increasing entropy is a fundamental driver of the origin and evolution of life. In his work, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is used to show how systems driven by external fields and subject to dissipation can spontaneously acquire lifelike properties as they explore configurations that more efficiently absorb and dissipate energy. Although England does not describe entropy as a field, his work emphasizes the primacy of entropic principles in shaping complex structures and adaptive behavior, reinforcing the broader theme that entropy is not merely a passive descriptor but an active organizing principle in nature.
  </p>

  <h3 id="sec-entropy-historical-foundations">
    <a id="anchor-entropy-historical-foundations"></a>
    Historical Foundations of Entropy as a Governing Principle
  </h3>

  <p>
    The modern view of entropy as a candidate for a foundational principle in physics is rooted in the classical developments of the nineteenth century. <strong>Rudolf Clausius</strong> introduced the term <strong>entropy</strong> and formulated the statement that the “entropy of the universe tends to a maximum,” which can be expressed schematically as
    <span class="mathjax">\( \Delta S_{\text{universe}} \geq 0 \)</span>.
    This encapsulates the second law of thermodynamics and establishes entropy as a quantity that constrains all natural processes. Although Clausius did not interpret entropy as a field, his formulation already suggests a global, law-like role for entropy in the evolution of the universe.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Ludwig Boltzmann</strong> provided the statistical foundation for entropy by relating it to the number of microscopic configurations compatible with a given macroscopic state. His famous relation
    <span class="mathjax">\( S = k_{\mathrm{B}} \ln W \)</span>
    connects the macroscopic entropy \( S \) to the number of microstates \( W \), with \( k_{\mathrm{B}} \) the Boltzmann constant. This statistical interpretation makes explicit the link between entropy and the structure of configuration space, and it underlies the modern understanding of the <strong>arrow of time</strong> as arising from the tendency of systems to evolve from less probable (low-entropy) macrostates to more probable (high-entropy) ones. In this sense, Boltzmann’s work anticipates later ideas in which entropy is seen as a measure of accessibility of configurations, a notion that is central to the Theory of Entropicity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Subsequent developments in statistical mechanics, quantum theory, and information theory have reinforced the view that entropy is deeply connected to the structure of physical law. The emergence of <strong>Shannon entropy</strong> in information theory, the role of <strong>entanglement entropy</strong> in quantum field theory and quantum gravity, and the appearance of entropy in black hole thermodynamics and holographic dualities all point toward a unifying theme: entropy is not merely a thermodynamic bookkeeping device but a structural quantity that encodes the organization of information and the accessibility of states in physical systems.
  </p>

  <h3 id="sec-entropy-field-spacetime">
    <a id="anchor-entropy-field-spacetime"></a>
    Entropy as a Field More Fundamental than Spacetime
  </h3>

  <p>
    Against this historical and conceptual background, Obidi’s Theory of Entropicity advances a precise and explicit claim: <strong>entropy is a universal field more fundamental than spacetime itself</strong>. In this view, the entropic field is the primary ontological entity, and spacetime is an emergent, effective construct that summarizes how this field organizes possible configurations and constrains dynamical evolution. The entropic field is treated as a scalar field of accessibility, and its gradients determine preferred directions of evolution, much as gradients of a potential determine motion in classical mechanics.
  </p>

  <p>
    This formulation differs from other entropic or informational approaches in that it does not merely derive specific forces (such as gravity) or specific aspects of temporal ordering from entropic considerations. Instead, it posits that the entire fabric of spacetime, together with its metric and causal structure, is a manifestation of the underlying entropic field. The theory thus seeks to unify gravitational, thermodynamic, and informational phenomena within a single entropic ontology, in which the fundamental question at each event is not “what is the curvature here?” but “what is the entropic accessibility here, and how does it constrain the evolution of the universe?”
  </p>

  <p>
    In summary, while many contemporary frameworks treat entropy, information, or statistical structure as central to the emergence of spacetime and physical law, the Theory of Entropicity is distinctive in explicitly declaring entropy to be the <strong>fundamental field of existence</strong> from which spacetime arises. This positions entropy not as a derivative quantity or a secondary descriptor, but as the primary field that defines the ontology and dynamics of the universe.
