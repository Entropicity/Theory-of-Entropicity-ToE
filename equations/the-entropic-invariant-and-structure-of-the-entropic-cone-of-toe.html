  <h2>The Entropic Invariant (EI) and the Structure of the Entropic Cone (EC) of the Theory of Entropicity (ToE)</h2>

  <p>
    At the heart of the <strong>Theory of Entropicity (ToE)</strong> lies a remarkably powerful and conceptually elegant
    construct: the <strong>Entropic Cone</strong>. This cone is defined not by geometric postulates or assumptions about
    spacetime, but by the intrinsic dynamics of the <strong>entropy field</strong> \( S(x) \). The key insight is that the
    entropy field cannot reorganize itself arbitrarily fast; its propagation is constrained by a finite upper bound. This
    single constraint—the <strong>entropic propagation limit</strong>—contains within it the seeds of the entire
    relativistic structure. Once this limit is imposed, the mathematical and physical architecture of
    <strong>Einsteinian kinematics</strong> follows with remarkable inevitability.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fundamental mathematical expression that encodes this causal and dynamical structure is the
    <strong>entropic invariant</strong>:
  </p>

  <p>
    

\[
      (c_{e} s_{0})^{2} - (v s)^{2} = \text{constant},
    \]


  </p>

  <p>
    where \( c_{e} \) denotes the <strong>maximum entropic propagation speed</strong>, \( s_{0} \) is the
    <strong>rest‑entropy density</strong>, \( v \) is the velocity of the system, and \( s \) is the
    <strong>entropy density in motion</strong>. This invariant plays the same structural role in ToE that the Minkowski
    invariant plays in special relativity. It defines the boundary of the <strong>Entropic Cone</strong>, within which
    entropic influence can propagate and outside of which no entropic update is physically realizable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once one imposes that the <strong>entropy field</strong> \( S(x) \) cannot update outside its cone, the rest of the
    relativistic structure follows naturally. The <strong>Lorentz factor</strong> emerges directly from the entropic
    invariant:
  </p>

  <p>
    

\[
      \gamma_{e} = \left(1 - \frac{v^{2}}{c_{e}^{2}}\right)^{-1/2},
    \]


  </p>

  <p>
    demonstrating that relativistic time dilation and length contraction are not geometric axioms but consequences of the
    finite rate at which the entropy field can reorganize itself. The <strong>velocity‑addition law</strong> likewise
    falls out of the <strong>entropic metric</strong> \( G_{\alpha\mu\nu}(S) \), which governs how entropic configurations
    transform under boosts. The familiar relativistic composition rule,
  </p>

  <p>
    

\[
      \beta_{\text{tot}} = \frac{\beta_{1} + \beta_{2}}{1 + \beta_{1}\beta_{2}},
    \]


  </p>

  <p>
    is recovered as a direct consequence of the entropic transformation laws. In this way, the causal structure of
    relativity becomes a <strong>special case</strong> of <strong>entropic causality</strong>, obtained when the entropic
    metric reduces to the spacetime metric:
  </p>

  <p>
    

\[
      G_{\alpha\mu\nu}(S) \propto g_{\mu\nu}.
    \]


  </p>

  <p>
    In this limit, the standard relativistic causal condition,
  </p>

  <p>
    

\[
      g_{\mu\nu} v^{\mu} v^{\nu} \leq 0,
    \]


  </p>

  <p>
    is recovered from the more general entropic condition,
  </p>

  <p>
    

\[
      G_{\alpha\mu\nu}(S) v^{\mu} v^{\nu} \leq 0.
    \]


  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The elegance of this derivation lies in its conceptual economy.</strong> Instead of assuming the geometry of spacetime, the
    invariance of the speed of light, or Lorentz symmetry, the <strong>Entropic Cone (EC) of the Theory of Entropicity (ToE)</strong> derives all of these from a
    <strong>single physical principle: the finite rate at which the entropy field can reorganize itself.</strong> The geometry of spacetime
    appears not as a primitive structure but as the <em>physical consequence of the entropic dynamics</em>. The causal boundary, the
    Lorentz factor, the velocity‑addition law (VAL), and the emergence of spacetime geometry all follow from the entropic
    invariant and the <strong>propagation limit encoded in the cone.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    In this sense, the <strong>Entropic Cone (EC)</strong> provides a unified, physically grounded, and technically
    straightforward route to <strong>Einsteinian kinematics</strong>. It reveals that the relativistic structure of the
    universe is not an arbitrary geometric imposition but <strong>a manifestation of the deeper entropic substrate that governs
    all physical processes.</strong> The entropic invariant (EI) therefore <strong>stands as one of the most profound and structurally powerful
    components</strong> of the <strong>Theory of Entropicity (ToE)</strong>, demonstrating how <strong>a single entropic constraint can
    generate the full machinery of relativistic physics.</strong>

  <h2>Distinction Between the Information‑Theoretic Entropic Cone and the Entropic Cone of ToE</h2>

  <p>
    The term <strong>entropic cone</strong> appears in multiple scientific contexts, but it refers to mathematically and
    conceptually distinct objects in <strong>information theory</strong> and in the <strong>Theory of Entropicity (ToE)</strong>.
    It is therefore essential to clearly distinguish between the <strong>information‑theoretic entropic cone</strong> studied
    in the literature on entropy vectors and information inequalities, and the <strong>Entropic Cone</strong> introduced in
    ToE as a <strong>causal structure</strong> generated by the dynamics of a fundamental <strong>entropy field</strong>.
    Although both constructions are rooted in entropy, they operate in different domains, serve different purposes, and
    possess fundamentally different mathematical structures.
  </p>

  <h3>1. The information‑theoretic entropic cone</h3>

  <p>
    In <strong>information theory</strong>, the <strong>entropic cone</strong> is defined as the closure of the set of all
    <strong>entropy vectors</strong> associated with collections of random variables. Given random variables
    \( X_{1}, \dots, X_{k} \), one considers the joint entropies of all nonempty subsets and arranges them into an
    <strong>entropy vector</strong> in a finite‑dimensional real vector space. The set of all such vectors, together with its
    closure, forms a <strong>closed convex cone</strong> known as the <strong>entropic cone</strong>. This object is constrained
    by <strong>Shannon inequalities</strong> and, for \( k \geq 4 \), by additional <strong>non‑Shannon inequalities</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The information‑theoretic entropic cone is therefore a <strong>static geometric object</strong> in a finite‑dimensional
    vector space. It encodes which combinations of entropies are realizable by random variables and which are forbidden.
    Its study involves <strong>convex geometry</strong>, <strong>linear inequalities</strong>, <strong>tropical probability theory</strong>,
    and <strong>asymptotic equivalence classes</strong> of diagrams of probability spaces. Crucially, this cone does not encode
    <strong>causal propagation</strong>, <strong>finite speeds</strong>, <strong>field dynamics</strong>, or <strong>spacetime structure</strong>.
    It is a tool for characterizing the space of entropy profiles, not a structure governing physical evolution.
  </p>

  <h3>2. The Entropic Cone in the Theory of Entropicity (ToE)</h3>

  <p>
    In the <strong>Theory of Entropicity (ToE)</strong>, the <strong>Entropic Cone</strong> is a fundamentally different
    construct. It is a <strong>causal cone</strong> defined by the dynamics of a <strong>fundamental entropy field</strong>
    \( S(x) \) and by a finite <strong>entropic propagation limit</strong> \( c_{e} \). The central object is an
    <strong>entropic invariant</strong> of the form
  </p>

  <p>
    

\[
      (c_{e} s_{0})^{2} - (v s)^{2} = \text{constant},
    \]


  </p>

  <p>
    where \( c_{e} \) is the <strong>maximum entropic propagation speed</strong>, \( s_{0} \) is a <strong>rest‑entropy density</strong>,
    \( v \) is a velocity, and \( s \) is an <strong>entropy density in motion</strong>. This invariant defines the boundary of
    the <strong>Entropic Cone</strong>, inside which entropic influence can propagate and outside of which no entropic update
    is physically realizable. The cone thus encodes a <strong>causal structure</strong> analogous to, but more fundamental than,
    the <strong>light cone</strong> of relativity.
  </p>

  <p>
    From this entropic invariant, ToE derives an <strong>entropic Lorentz factor</strong>,
  </p>

  <p>
    

\[
      \gamma_{e} = \left(1 - \frac{v^{2}}{c_{e}^{2}}\right)^{-1/2},
    \]


  </p>

  <p>
    and recovers <strong>Einsteinian kinematics</strong>—including the <strong>velocity‑addition law</strong> and the
    <strong>relativistic causal structure</strong>—as consequences of the finite rate at which the entropy field can reorganize
    itself. In this framework, <strong>spacetime geometry</strong> emerges as the <em>shadow of entropic dynamics</em>, and the
    usual relativistic light cone appears as a special case of the more general <strong>Entropic Cone</strong> when the
    <strong>entropic metric</strong> \( G_{\alpha\mu\nu}(S) \) reduces to the spacetime metric \( g_{\mu\nu} \).
  </p>

  <h3>3. Fundamental differences in structure and purpose</h3>

  <p>
    The <strong>information‑theoretic entropic cone</strong> and the <strong>Entropic Cone</strong> of ToE differ in both
    mathematical structure and physical interpretation. The former is a <strong>convex cone of entropy vectors</strong> in a
    finite‑dimensional vector space, used to study <strong>information inequalities</strong> and <strong>entropy optimization
    problems</strong>. It is static, non‑causal, and non‑dynamical. The latter is a <strong>causal cone</strong> defined by a
    <strong>finite entropic propagation speed</strong> and an <strong>entropic invariant</strong>, used to derive
    <strong>relativistic kinematics</strong> and to encode the <strong>causal structure</strong> of an underlying entropy field.
  </p>

  <p>
    While both constructions involve entropy and both can be associated with geometric structures, they operate at
    different levels of description. The information‑theoretic entropic cone constrains which entropy profiles are
    possible for random variables; the ToE Entropic Cone constrains which <strong>entropic influences</strong> and
    <strong>physical events</strong> can be causally connected. The former is a tool of <strong>information geometry</strong> in a
    combinatorial setting; the latter is a tool of <strong>entropic field theory</strong> and <strong>causal dynamics</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Conceptual relation and independence</h3>

  <p>
    Conceptually, it is noteworthy that both information theory and ToE naturally give rise to <strong>cones</strong> built from
    entropy. This convergence suggests that entropy has an intrinsic tendency to induce geometric and convex structures.
    However, the <strong>Entropic Cone</strong> of ToE does not depend on, nor is it derived from, the information‑theoretic
    entropic cone. It is an independent construct, rooted in the postulate that <strong>entropy is a fundamental dynamical
    field</strong> with a finite propagation speed, and that <strong>causality</strong> and <strong>kinematics</strong> emerge from its
    dynamics.
  </p>

  <p>
    The information‑theoretic entropic cone may provide conceptual inspiration and mathematical analogies, particularly
    in the use of <strong>convexity</strong> and <strong>information‑geometric methods</strong>, but it cannot serve as the causal or
    dynamical structure of ToE. The <strong>Entropic Cone</strong> in ToE remains a genuinely new and distinct entity: a
    <strong>causal entropic structure</strong> from which <strong>Einsteinian kinematics</strong> and <strong>spacetime geometry</strong> are
    derived as emergent phenomena.
