# Theory-of-Entropicity-ToE
Official repository for the Theory of Entropicity (ToE) — a foundational framework unifying geometry, information, and entropy into a single entropic field theory. This site hosts the evolving conceptual architecture, mathematical formulations, and expository materials that define ToE.

The Theory of Entropicity (ToE) is an original, field‑theoretic framework that positions entropy as the fundamental substrate of reality. This repository serves as the official digital home of the theory, consolidating its conceptual foundations, mathematical structures, derivations, expository essays, and developmental history.

Purpose of This Repository
Preserve the canonical formulations of ToE

Provide a structured archive of equations, principles, and derivations

Document the evolution of the theory from early insights to formal results

Offer accessible expositions for researchers, students, and the general public

Serve as a stable, long‑term reference independent of any single publishing platform

What You Will Find Here
Core definitions and axioms of the Theory of Entropicity

The Master Entropic Equation and Obidi Field Equations

Conceptual essays and explanatory notes

Mathematical derivations and geometric interpretations

Links to formal papers published on ResearchGate, SSRN, Academia, Figshare, and Cambridge Open Engage

A chronological record of the theory’s development

Why This Repository Exists
The Theory of Entropicity is developed through a multi‑stage diffusion pipeline:

Early ideas circulate through Blogger, Medium, LinkedIn, and Substack

Mature concepts are consolidated into formal papers

Final versions are archived in academic repositories

These “frozen” ideas then return to public platforms for renewed exposition and broader dissemination

This GitHub repository acts as the central, authoritative anchor connecting all stages of that pipeline.

Mission
To establish the Theory of Entropicity as a rigorous, coherent, and enduring scientific framework — accessible to specialists and non‑specialists alike, and preserved across generations.
