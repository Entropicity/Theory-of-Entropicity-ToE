# Theory-of-Entropicity-ToE
Official repository for the Theory of Entropicity (ToE) — a foundational framework unifying geometry, information, and entropy into a single entropic field theory. This site hosts the evolving conceptual architecture, mathematical formulations, and expository materials that define ToE.
